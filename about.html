<p>
This is a simulator for the <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/hp15.htm">HP-15C</a> advanced scientific programmable calculator.
This simulator aims to include all features of the HP-15C including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Complex arithmetic
    <li>Matrix math
    <li>Numerical integration
    <li>Numeric equation solver
    <li>Programmability
    <li>Statistics functions
</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
I bought my HP-15C in 1987 as my first RPN calculator, and used it throughout university.
I still have my original one, and it continues to operate on the <em>same</em> set of batteries, after 23 years.
The form factor (horizontal layout) is the distinctive feature of this family of calculators.
There is even a <a href="http://hp15c.org">Petition to Bring Back the 15C</a>.
</p>

<p>
This implementation was inspired by the <a href="http://www.hpmuseum.org/simulate/hp35sim/hp35sim.htm">HP-35 Calculator Simulator</a> at the Museum of HP Calculators.
</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>
The following functions are known to be incomplete or nonfunctional:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some rounding errors in functions like -&gt;H.MS
    <li>Numeric range checking
    <li>Blink flag (flag 9)
    <li>Engineering (ENG) notation
    <li>Register access 10-19 using ".n"
    <li>Indirect GTO through I register
    <li>Indirect matrix access through I register
    <li>Complex transcendental functions: ln log abs sin asin cos acos tan atan sinh asinh cosh acosh tanh atanh
    <li>Matrix functions: chs, residual, row norm, frobenius norm, determinant, scalar /
</ul>
